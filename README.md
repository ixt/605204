# 60//5\204

A sequel to 60//5\203, now with automation!

in this repo there is:  
    * an article list   
    * a python scrypt with no none core dependencies  
    * a shell script that goes through the list summarising the articles with sumy and then putting the output through the python script  

I am using sumy to summarise the articles before I process them, but the script accepts any plain text with enoguh words that can fulfil the requirements of the scirpt (this varies).
