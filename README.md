# 60//5\204

A sequel to 60//5\203, now with automation!

in this repo there is:  
    * an article list   
    * a python scrypt with no none core dependencies  
    * a shell script that goes through the list, grabbing the articles putting the output through the python script  

Using lynx to get the articles is good _most_ of the time
